## Note

A CMB-dipole-aligned signal is strongly present across all surveys with
sufficient redshift depth (p-values from 10^-6 to effectively zero).
The v1.1 rank-must-be-#1 criterion is vulnerable to survey footprint
asymmetry and cannot confirm the signal to the pre-registered standard.

See the full report for detailed analysis of each result.
BOAT v2 is planned with revised criteria.
